# Overview

The Quote application is a simple website that serves a random quote to the
user.  The application is seeded with a few quotes and more can be added via the "Add" link on the bottom left.

## Getting Started with the Application

### Github
The Quote application can be found at this Github repository -

https://github.com/cmu-mis-iccfb-spring-17/quote-app-monolith

You should fork this repository and clone your copy from Github.  You will
be working out of your copy at this point.

### Gradle
The application is built using Gradle.  You can read more about Gradle here -

https://gradle.org/

The application's repository contains a Gradle Wrapper file that you will use
to get started.  When you issue a build command, the Gradle Wrapper will
automatically download the appropriate version of Gradle and start the build.
The build will then download all the required dependencies for the application.

To build issue this command -

    ./gradlew build
